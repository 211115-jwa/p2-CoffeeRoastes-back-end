# Coffee Roastes Vanquish end
1. Your team will spend 15-20 minutes coming up with ideas for the project. You should come up with 2-3 ideas, then write a 1-2 sentence proposal for each application and send it to me.
3. Once I have approved one of your proposals, your team will write ~10 user stories for the project. Assign point values to each story, then add the stories to a Trello board and share it with me.
4. Your team will need to create GitHub repositories for the front end and back end, then share these with me as well (or just create them in the 211115-jwa organization).
5. Create an ERD for the application and share/discuss the draft with me so that I can make suggestions as necessary.
6. Write feature files for at least 5 user stories.

Project Proposal 1: Team Vanquish is proposing to create an ecommerce website for the buying of Cofffe Roasters. This website will have all of the standard features where users can login, cart, search and more.
